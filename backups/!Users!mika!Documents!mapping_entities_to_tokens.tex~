\section{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Input is a text $t = c_1, \ldots, c_{N_t}$ of (unicode)
  characters (we use 1-based indexing here; also, here and in the
  following $N_\_$ will denote the number of different elements of
  type $\_$ and we will omit the type where clear from the context)
\item The input $t$ is split into a series of tokens by the
  tokenization function $\tok$ as follows:
  \begin{equation}
    T = \tok(t) = \{t_i | i=1,\ldots, N_T\}
  \end{equation}
\item Each token $t_i$ is itself described as a tuple of 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Token type
  \item Span, describing a \emph{single} consequtive sequence of characters $c_i$ from the original text $t$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Formally we have
  \begin{equation}
    t_i = (z\in\{\text{Person}, \text{Location}, \ldots\}, (b, n)\in\mathbb{I}\times\mathbb{I}\}\})
  \end{equation}
  where $0 \leq b \leq b+n \leq N_t$ and the actual token text is $c_bc_{b+1}\ldots c_{b+n}$.
\item Further, the input $t$ is annotated into a series of annotations by the function $\ann$ as follows:
  \begin{equation}
    A = \ann(t) = \{a_i | i=1,\ldots,N_A\}   
  \end{equation}
\item Each annotation $a_i$ is itself similar to a token $t_i$ as it
  has a type $z$ but it is described by a series of spans $(b_k,
  n_k)\in\mathbb{I}\times\mathbb{I}, k=1,\ldots,N_{a_i}$ and $0\leq
  b_k\leq b_k+n_k\leq b_{k+1}\leq N_t$, i.e.~the spans are ordered and
  do not overlap (but are not necessarily consequtive).
\end{enumerate}
