    Currently this uses a very dumb approach, as it is only used to split the payload to ducking and a like in more managable chunks:

    1. Split when two newlines are encountered

    Returns a list with dicts of the form split=[{'sentence': 'the text', 'start': s, 'end': e}] such that
    sentence = txt[start:end] and txt == ''.join([s['sentence'] for s in split])
