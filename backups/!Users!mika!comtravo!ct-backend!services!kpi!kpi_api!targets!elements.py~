misc_breakfast_item_filter = {
    # Do not count misc items that are just separated breakfast
    # charges.  The logic is, well, dangerous. The decision is made on
    # the description which is analyzed. Any item starting with
    # "Frühstück" (probable preceeded by "1x, 2x, ...") should be
    # excluded. There are, however, items with "Frühstück" that should
    # explicitely not excluded. They are at least for 11/2016 of the
    # form "Nachbelastung...". So I check for descriptions that have
    # "frühstück" but not "nachbelastung". This can of course easily
    # break...  Similary in english the logic is "breakfast" and not
    # "additional charge"; here the situation is slightly worse as I
    # need to match two words...
